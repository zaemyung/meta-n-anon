    This is the single, importable implementation of the pre_process pipeline,
    shared by :class:`MetaLayer`, :class:`~meta_n.core.agentic_solver.AgenticSolver`,
    and the external-agents ``InjectionMapper``. Behavior matches the original
    private methods exactly:

    - Each block is validated with :func:`meta_n.utils.safety.validate_code`;
      blocks that fail validation, raise, or return a non-``str``
      ``additional_context`` are skipped (logged at WARNING).
    - Blocks execute **deepest-first** (i.e. ``reversed(injected_codes)``),
      mirroring the MetaLayer chain where the outermost (deepest) layer runs
      first and its emission becomes ``outer_context`` for inner layers.
    - The exec namespace is seeded with ``task`` (a defensive deep copy — a
      block can never mutate the live task), ``additional_context`` (the
      per-block input, default ``""``), and ``outer_context`` (the *outer_context*
      argument for the first block, then the running accumulation for the rest).
    - The returned ``context`` is only the **accumulation of block emissions**;
      it does NOT include the *outer_context* argument itself. This preserves the
      original ``MetaLayer._run_pre_process`` contract (which returned just the
      block's own emission, with ``outer_context`` only seeded into the namespace)
      as well as ``AgenticSolver._run_all_pre_process`` (which seeded
      ``outer_context=""`` and returned the full accumulation).

    Args:
        injected_codes: The injected-code layers (any order; processed
            deepest-first). Layers without a ``pre_process`` are ignored.
        task: The task being solved; exposed as ``task`` in the namespace.
        additional_context: Seed value for the namespace ``additional_context``
            input on every block (the original methods always seeded ``""``).
        outer_context: Guidance from higher meta-layers; seeded into the first
            block's namespace ``outer_context`` (then superseded by the running
            accumulation), but NOT prepended to the returned context.
        thread_outer_context: When ``True`` (default), each block's emission is
            appended into the ``outer_context`` seen by subsequent (inner) blocks,
            so inner layers are conditioned on the running deepest-first
            accumulation. When ``False``, ``outer_context`` stays pinned at its seed
            value for every block (the intra-call inter-layer channel is ablated).
            The returned ``context`` (block-emission accumulation) is INDEPENDENT of
            this flag, so the solver prompt is byte-identical either way; only the
            per-block ``outer_context`` INPUT differs.

    Returns:
        ``(ran, context)`` — ``ran`` is ``True`` if at least one block produced
        non-empty context, and ``context`` is the accumulated emission.
