"""Unified LLM client supporting OpenRouter and Azure OpenAI.

Backend is selected via ``LLMConfig.backend``:

  * ``openrouter`` (default) — talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
    (OpenRouter, vLLM, LMStudio) via ``AsyncOpenAI`` with a custom
    ``base_url``. The legacy path; nothing changes for existing callers.
  * ``azure`` — uses ``AsyncAzureOpenAI``. ``model`` is treated as the
    deployment name. Pricing is keyed on the deployment string, so name
    deployments after the model family (``gpt-4.1``, ``gpt-5.2``, …) or
    add an alias to ``meta_n/utils/cost_tracker.PRICING``.

When ``daily_budget_usd > 0``, every call routes through ``CostTracker``:
``assert_under_cap`` before the request, ``record`` after. A cap hit
raises :class:`BudgetExceededError` (a ``BaseException`` subclass) which
bypasses ``except Exception`` blocks in benchmark integrations and
propagates up to the orchestrator's checkpoint-save path.

    The whole mechanism rests on the ABSENCE of a ``candidate_id`` parameter:

    SAME seed, so on a seed-honouring backend the LLM-sampler luck is correlated
    and the paired child-vs-parent comparison cancels the shared noise.

    Implementation notes (each a unit-tested invariant):
      * ``hashlib.blake2b`` — NOT builtin ``hash()``, which is salted per-process
        via ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` and would break ``--resume`` and the CO-Bench

        the same key). blake2b is deterministic across calls / processes /

        ``(task="a", r=11)`` vs ``(task="a1", r=1)``.
      * masked to a non-negative 31-bit int so every backend's integer seed

    Args:
        run_seed: the run-level base (``EvolutionaryConfig.seed`` / ``--seed``).
            Different ``run_seed`` ⇒ different seed (the lever that keeps the
            best-of-N control's runs independent).
        task_id: the task identifier.
        repeat_index: 0-based repeated-eval index. Different index ⇒ different
            seed, so ``eval_repeats`` re-solves stay diverse and CRN composes
            WITH repeated eval instead of collapsing it.

        Send a chat completion request.

        Retries transient errors (404 on OpenRouter, connection/timeout,
        JSON-decode, 429, 5xx) in this wrapper's own loop — throttle classes
        (429/5xx) back off from a >=15s base delay. SDK-internal retries are
        disabled (both clients are constructed with max_retries=0), so this
        wrapper is the single source of truth for retry policy.

        Side effect: each successful call increments ``self.cumulative_usage``
        with the prompt/completion/total token counts the API returned.

            seed: optional per-request CRN seed (paired eval). Forwarded to
                ``chat.completions.create()`` ONLY when the backend is known to
