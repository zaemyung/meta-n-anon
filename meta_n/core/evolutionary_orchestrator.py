        native path.

        The spine is used when ``base_solver`` is a genuine external kind
        (``openhands`` / ``terminus2`` — anything other than ``None`` / ``builtin``),
        OR when ``base_solver == "builtin"`` AND the bound adapter advertises that it
        wants ``builtin`` on the spine (``advertises_spine_builtin()`` — only the
        terminal_bench adapter does, where the native executor cannot run the legacy
        task layout). ``base_solver in (None, "builtin")`` with a NON-advertising
        adapter (CO-Bench, text-classification, …) stays on the legacy native path,
        byte-for-byte unchanged — so CO-Bench's ``builtin`` baseline never regresses.

        This single predicate replaces the scattered
        ``base_solver not in (None, "builtin")`` guards, so the seed / evaluate /
        gate / solver-build dispatch all agree on one routing rule. The rule
        itself lives in :func:`meta_n.core.spine_routing.uses_external_spine`
        (main.py's startup guards call the same function — one routing rule,
        two entry points).

            ``True`` if the spine + ``ExternalAgentSolver`` should drive this run.

        it inline instead of calling it (``utilities_called`` excludes every

        verification; a prior helper a later layer never touches stays verified as

        injected`` at the real call site, or supplied via ``injected`` when
